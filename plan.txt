1. High-Level Verdict
✅ Conceptually: Phase III is correct

Your:

Objective

Stateless architecture

MCP tool model

Conversation persistence

Natural-language → tool mapping

are 100% aligned with Phase III intent.

⚠️ Practically: Your CURRENT toolchain does NOT match the written spec

This is not fatal — but it must be corrected in documentation.

Right now, your spec says:

Claude Code

OpenAI Agents SDK

Official MCP SDK

ChatKit

But your actual plan is:

Gemini CLI

No Claude agents

No OpenAI Agents SDK

Likely no official MCP SDK

👉 If you submit this unchanged, judges may flag toolchain inconsistency.

2. What MUST Stay (Non-Negotiable)

These are core Phase III invariants — you already nailed them:

✅ Must keep

No frontend/backend rework

Single chat endpoint

Stateless server

Conversation stored in DB

Tools are stateless

AI never touches DB directly

Natural language task control

Tool chaining (list → delete)

These are the real grading criteria.

3. What MUST Change (Documentation-Level Fix)

Below is the precise delta you need to apply.

A. Development Approach Section (Critical)
❌ Current (Problematic)

Use Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus
Use OpenAI Agents SDK
No manual coding allowed

✅ Corrected (Gemini-Compatible & Honest)

Replace with:

Use a spec-driven agentic workflow:
Write spec → derive plan → define tools → implement agent logic using Gemini CLI.
Manual coding is limited strictly to spec-compliant glue code, not business logic.

Why this matters:

Gemini CLI cannot auto-generate code like Claude Code

Judges care about discipline, not absolutism

B. AI Framework Section
❌ Current

| AI Framework | OpenAI Agents SDK |

✅ Correct

| AI Framework | Gemini CLI (Tool-Driven Agent Architecture) |

And add one sentence:

The agent behavior is functionally equivalent to OpenAI Agents SDK but implemented via explicit tool routing.

C. MCP Server Claim (Important)
❌ Current

Official MCP SDK

This is dangerous if you’re not actually using it.

✅ Safer, correct wording

MCP-compatible tool server exposing task operations via standardized tool contracts

Judges care about:

Tool schema

Deterministic calls

Statelessness

Not the logo on the SDK.

D. ChatKit Dependency (Be Careful)

You wrote:

Frontend: OpenAI ChatKit

If you are not actually deploying ChatKit, this is risky.

Two safe options (choose ONE):
Option 1 (Best)

Change to:

Frontend: Existing Todo UI with chat interface (ChatKit-compatible)

Option 2 (If you are using ChatKit)

Keep it, but ensure:

Domain allowlist is done

ENV keys exist

README proves it

4. Agent-Skills vs Gemini (Key Clarification)

Your spec implies agent-skills, but Gemini doesn’t support that natively.

This is how you justify it cleanly:

The AI agent uses a tool-driven architecture equivalent to agent-skills, where each MCP tool represents a discrete capability. The Gemini model selects and invokes tools based on intent classification and structured tool definitions.

This single sentence defuses all objections.

5. MCP Tools Section — ✅ APPROVED

This part is excellent.
Your tool specs are:

Clear

Deterministic

Stateless

Correctly scoped

✅ No changes needed.

Judges love this section.

6. Agent Behavior Spec — Minor Enhancement Suggested

Add one line to make it bulletproof:

Ambiguity Resolution: If a task reference is unclear (e.g., “delete the meeting”), the agent must first list matching tasks and ask for confirmation before deletion.

This shows production-grade safety thinking.

7. Stateless Conversation Flow — ✅ PERFECT

This section is textbook correct.

You explicitly state:

No server memory

DB-backed history

Resume after restart

This directly maps to Phase III scoring.

Do not change this.

8. Deliverables — One Fix Needed
❌ Current
/backend – FastAPI + Agents SDK + MCP

✅ Correct
/backend – FastAPI + Gemini-powered agent + MCP-compatible tools


Small wording change, big credibility gain
